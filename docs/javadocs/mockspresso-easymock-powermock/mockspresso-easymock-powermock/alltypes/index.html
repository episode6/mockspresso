<td>
<p>A FieldPreparer for Powermock + EasyMock. Powermock doesn't seem to offer a nice way to init mocks on an arbitrary object that isn't the testClass (and the runner/rule deals with those). So to handle testResources, we use this custom FieldPreparer that expects some mocks/spies to already be initialized (and doesn't touch those). We use <code><a href="https://static.javadoc.io/org.powermock/powermock-api-easymock/2.0.0/org/powermock/api/easymock/PowerMock.html#createMock(java.lang.Class<T>)">PowerMock#createMock(Class)</a></code> to create mocks.</p>

<p>Plugin that applies <code><a href="../com.episode6.hackit.mockspresso.easymock.powermock/-easy-power-mock-mocker-config/index.html">EasyPowerMockMockerConfig</a></code> to enable mockspresso usage with Powermock + EasyMock. This plugin does not apply a PowerMockRule, so the implementer is responsible for either running their test with the PowerMockRunner or applying their own PowerMockRule</p>

<p>Plugin that applies <code><a href="../com.episode6.hackit.mockspresso.easymock.powermock/-easy-power-mock-mocker-config/index.html">EasyPowerMockMockerConfig</a></code> AND applies a PowerMockRule as an outer rule to Mockspresso.
